The programs in this directory allow you to access the cookie file.
They will access one cookie at random and display it in their standard
output.

The program 'cook' will display the cookie in plain text format.

The program 'cookie-cgi' is a cgi helper application for HTTP daemons
and generates HTML output.

To install the programs you must first edit the Makefile, giving the
appropriate pathnames and run make.

Without arguments 'make' will build the executables in the current
directory.

'make all' is the same as 'make': it just builds the executables.

'make install' will install everything: the executables, screen backgrounds,
signature picture and database. Since the database is big, it may take a
long while to complete.

'make installbin' will only install the binaries, which is handy when you
have already installed the data files and want to make changes or debug
the programs.

'make uninstall' will remove all the installed files. Please, be sure you
no longer need any of them.

CREDITS: most of the backgrounds have been picked from the net. Well, actually
all of them. Wonderful thing the net. Really. Amazing.

	See the file '0readme' for credits on the database.

	The programs where made by me, Jose R. Valverde, to provide my 
colleagues at work with some access to that hughe file of citations that
so much impressed them. Since I was leaving, I thought, what the heck,
why not leave behind a small 'souvenir'?

	That's why there is a picture popping out from time to time. There's
nothing against removing it if you don't like it.

DISCLAIMER: the programs are unsupported. And all the usual disclaimers 
apply: I don't assume any responsibility either express or implicit or of
any type at all regarding anything at all relative to these programs and
son on, etc, etc, etc...

			Have fun!
