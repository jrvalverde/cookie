"The primary purpose of the DATA statement is to give names 
to constants; instead of referring to pi as 3.141592653589793 
at every appearance, the variable PI can be given that 
value with a DATA statement and used instead of the longer 
form of the constant. This also simplifies modifying the 
program, should the value of pi change."
